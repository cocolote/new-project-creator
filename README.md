##The new_project creator

Simple routine to create the scaffolds for a new Sinatra app.

####Instructions

Clone the repository into your projects directory

Run it like `ruby new_project.rb` and it will create a new directory
`new-project` with all the dependencies.

Or you could enter the name of your project like `ruby new_project.rb my-project`
and it will create the directory with that name.

Also if you already have a directory for your project it will add the dependencies
to it.
