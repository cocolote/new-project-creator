##The new_project creator

Simple routine to create all the files and basic directories to start
a new Sinatra app.

Clone the repository into your projects directory

Just run it like `ruby new_project.rb` and it will create a new directory
`new-project` and all the subdirectories.

also you could enter the name of your project like `ruby new_project.rb my-project`
and it will create the directory with that name.

If the project directory already exists it will add the sub directories to your
project.
