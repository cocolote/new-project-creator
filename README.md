The new_project creator

Simple routine to create all the files and basic directories to start
a new Sinatra app.

You need to place the file in the directory where you have all your
projects.

Then just run it (ruby new_project.rb) and it will create a new directory
new-project and all the subdirectories.

also you could enter the name of your project like (ruby new_project.rb ./my_project)
and it will create the directory with that name.
